# Optimized Logo README

The original logo, [as it was originally proposed](https://github.com/a11yTO/website/blob/master/Optimized-Logo/original-a11yto-logo.ai), had a lot of extraneous information contained in it. And by trimming/ combining pathâ€™s and organizing/ naming layers in Illustrator, the resulting SVG from each version of the logo went from 11kB to 4.1kB! 

Then by using [Peter Collingridge SVG Editor](https://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg-editor), to further remove redundant information (by using the "Conservative" optimization  setting and "remove whitespace" essentially), the result is in the neighbourhood of 3.9kB.
